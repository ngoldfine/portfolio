[back to top](./projects.html)

**Embedding Structure Matters**

[Publication](https://aclanthology.org/2023.mrl-1.20.pdf)

- Performed **data visualization** and **qualitative analysis** on the sub-word embeddings of a **cross-lingual language model**, using **dimensionality reduction**, **Seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.
- Evaluated language model performance on a named entity recognition (**NER**) task using **PyTorch** and **NumPy**.
- Aided adaptation of a large language model (**LLM**) to low- and mid-resource languages.
- Coauthored winner of [Best Paper Award at the 3rd Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning (MRL)](https://sigtyp.github.io/ws2023-mrl.html).

**Predicting Human Empathy and Emotion**

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/manisha-Singh-UW/LING573_HUE-Human-Understanding-and-Empathy)

- **Collaboratively coded** on **GitHub** with a small team of other students, earning 5th and 6th place on the leaderboards for two WASSA shared tasks at the time of submission.
- Performed **error analysis** on results for a natural language processing (**NLP**) regression task using **statistical analysis**, **matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Conclusions from this analysis guided improvements to the team’s strategy.
- Trained high-performing **machine learning** models from **Scikit-Learn** for an **ensemble**, improving performance on a **regression task**.

**Lexical Variation in Italian Literature**

[Course project paper](https://github.com/ngoldfine/portfolio/files/14779736/ling575_final_project.pdf)

- Resourcefully **curated a multilingual dataset** of historical Italian-peninsula texts from online sources.
- Utilized **Python**, **SpaCy**, **Jupyter Notebook**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, **matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to preprocess, analyze and visualize data.
- **Leveraged domain knowledge** of Italian language during dataset cleaning and analysis, allowing for a more informed and nuanced interpretation of results.

**Spoken Dialect Identification for an Endangered Language Using the Lidbox Toolkit**

[Course project paper](https://github.com/ngoldfine/portfolio/files/15228789/final.paper.pdf)

- Assessed a neural **language identification** toolkit's performance on **voice data** for dialects of Romansh, an endangered language.
- Utilized **Python**, **Pandas** and **Jupyter Notebook** to evaluate neural models.

**Indicators of Tense and Aspect in the Sundanese Language**

[Course project paper](https://github.com/ngoldfine/portfolio/files/15228896/field.methods.final.project.anonymized.pdf)

- Collaborated with native speaker consultants to build a dataset using linguistic field methods.
- Phonetically transcribed spoken language data.
- Examined an area of Sundanese syntax through analysis of language data.

**Conditional Constructions in the Hoocąk Language**

[Course project paper](https://github.com/ngoldfine/portfolio/files/15228826/ling571.final.project.pdf)

- Curated a dataset to explore the syntax and morphology of an indigenous endangered language.
- Diligently annotated language data with morphological information by hand to analyze the structure of conditional constructions.
- Assisted language revitalization efforts by sharing the final project paper with the Hoocąk language community.

**Lingue italiane: storia e dialetti moderni** and **Lingue regionali in Italia**

- Researched and delivered presentations on Italian historical linguistics, modern Italian dialectology and linguistic diversity.
- Expertly delivered 20-minute presentations entirely in Italian, including fielding audience questions.

**SQL Squirrels**

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/ngoldfine/SQL-squirrels)

- Conducted **exploratory data analysis** of the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census using **SQLite**.

**Wordle Guessers**

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/ngoldfine/wordle-guessers)

- Implemented and tested algorithms for solving Wordle puzzles.
- Utilized Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**) in **Python**.
