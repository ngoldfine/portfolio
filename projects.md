# Projects

### Embedding Structure Matters
[Publication](https://aclanthology.org/2023.mrl-1.20.pdf)

- Performed **data visualization** and **qualitative analysis** on the sub-word embeddings of a **cross-lingual language model**, using **dimensionality reduction**, **Seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.
- Evaluated language model performance on a named entity recognition (**NER**) task.
- Aided adaptation of a large language model (**LLM**) to low- and mid-resource languages.
- Coauthored winner of [Best Paper Award at the 3rd Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning (MRL)](https://sigtyp.github.io/ws2023-mrl.html).

### Predicting Human Empathy and Emotion
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/manisha-Singh-UW/LING573_HUE-Human-Understanding-and-Empathy)
- **Collaboratively coded** with a small team of other students, earning 5th and 6th place on the leaderboards for two WASSA shared tasks at the time of submission.
- Performed **error analysis** on results for a natural language processing (**NLP**) regression task using **statistical analysis**, **matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Conclusions from this analysis guided improvements to the teamâ€™s strategy.
- Trained high-performing **machine learning** models from **Scikit-Learn** for an **ensemble**, improving performance on a **regression task**.

### Lexical Variation in Italian Literature

[Course project paper](https://github.com/ngoldfine/portfolio/files/14779736/ling575_final_project.pdf)

- Resourcefully **curated a multilingual dataset** of historical Italian-peninsula texts from online sources.
- Utilized **Python**, **SpaCy**, **Jupyter Notebook**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, **matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to preprocess, analyze and visualize data.
- Leveraged **Italian language knowledge** during dataset cleaning and analysis, allowing for a more informed and nuanced interpretation of results.

### Wordle Guessers

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/ngoldfine/wordle-guessers)

- Implemented and tested algorithms for solving Wordle puzzles.
- Utilized Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**) in **Python**.
